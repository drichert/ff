STRUCTURE




When my mother was driving back and forth in between the homes of husband A and husband B, what do you think she did in the interim?  If you, iris/irises were at the helm, how would the world adapt to suit your—not your need—but your longings?  Architectural harmony, says.  Arch of tones, says.  Bridge bridge bridge, says.  Sunset-peace, says.  Sunrise-joy, says.  Heaven and earth, says.  Everything else, says.  If I wished the world to be well, it would be well.  My bare arms would appear with fists of flowers.  Trumpeting petals.  A burst iris so that I could come down for breakfast.  Buried in the dark earth, the end of our suffering.  


Then that which you fear was over.  It ended abruptly.  The irises bent a little.  There are passages to and from other worlds.
